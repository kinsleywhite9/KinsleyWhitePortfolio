PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Recent advances in both Artificial Intelligent (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) make it possible to implement surveillance systems that can detect suspicious objects 
in an automatic manner. In this project, a student will use Raspberry Pi (RPi) along with portable Arducam IoTai to implement a surveillance system. The designed system 
utilizes RPi as a computing server, which receives the captured image from Arducam IoTai wirelessly and executes object detection. The student will use an object detector to 
detect objects in both images and video streams using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and Python.

REQUIRED HARDWARE COMPONENTS
-	Raspberry Pi
-	Arducam IoTai
